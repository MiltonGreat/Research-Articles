# COVID-19 and Health Insights

## Overview

This combined project performs a comprehensive analysis of health-related data with a primary focus on COVID-19 trends in Canada and the broader context of global health research. The project leverages multiple datasets to explore various aspects of COVID-19, including its spread, mortality rate, and the effectiveness of different medications, while also analyzing the broader public health trends in epidemics and other respiratory infections.

### Key Objectives

#### COVID-19 Data Analysis (Canada)

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer critical questions regarding COVID-19's impact across provinces in Canada.
- Analyze trends and patterns over time, focusing on cases, deaths, and mortality rates.
- Visualize key insights through graphs and charts to inform public health decisions.

#### EDA Questions

1. What is the total number of COVID-19 cases reported in each province?
2. Which province has the highest average rate of COVID-19 per capita?
3. What is the average rate of COVID-19 deaths per capita?
4. What is the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 in Canada?
5. What is the mortality rate per province?
6. What are the total reported cases per year?
7. For each year, identify the month with the highest and lowest number of cases.
8. Which year had the highest mortality rate?
9. Which year had the lowest total number of cases?
10. Which year had the highest total number of cases?
11. In 2020, on which day did Quebec have the highest number of COVID-19 deaths?

### Dataset

1. **COVID-19 Data in Canada**: Contains information on daily reported COVID-19 cases and deaths across Canadian provinces, sourced from the Government of Canada Public Health Infobase. This dataset allows for the analysis of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and per capita rates over time, as well as provincial comparisons.

2. **Medications and Diagnoses**: Focuses on the occurrence of medications and diagnoses mentioned in COVID-19-related abstracts. This dataset contains information about treatments (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin) and diagnoses (e.g., COVID-19, pneumonia) in scientific research papers, providing insights into the focus of medical research during the pandemic.

### Key Findings

#### COVID-19 Data (Canada)
- **Total Number of Cases per Province**: Ontario had the highest number of total COVID-19 cases (~223.5 million), followed by Quebec (~185.7 million).
- **Per Capita Rate of Cases**: Prince Edward Island had the highest average rate of COVID-19 cases per capita (15,328.76).
- **Average Rate of Deaths per Capita**: Quebec experienced the highest rate of deaths per capita (151.45).
- **Overall Mortality Rate**: The overall mortality rate of COVID-19 in Canada was 1.24%.
- **Yearly Trends**: 2023 saw the highest number of cases (~244.5 million), while 2020 had the fewest (~6.5 million cases).
- **Monthly Trends**: December consistently saw the highest total cases across most years, while February 2020 had the lowest number of cases.
- **Quebecâ€™s Deadliest Day**: December 26, 2020, was the deadliest day in Quebec, with 7,662 deaths.

#### Medications and Diagnoses Analysis

- **Most Mentioned Medications**: Chloroquine was the most frequently mentioned medication, with ritonavir and lopinavir also prominent in the research.
- **Key Research Focus**: Public health, pediatric respiratory infections, RNA virus research, and immune responses were prominent topics in the research.
- **Sentiment**: Research related to COVID-19 treatments generally exhibited a mix of caution and urgency, reflecting the global challenge of managing the pandemic.
